            The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of
            privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have
            played a significant role in the development of data protection laws
            around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice
            Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to
            complying with the various privacy laws that protect personal
            information.

          <p className=" max-md:text-[10px] md:text-lg">
            In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take
            the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 max-md:text-[10px] md:text-lg">
            <li>We will notify the users via email within 7 business days</li>

              We will notify the users via in-site notification within 7
              business days
            </li>
            <li>
              We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires
              that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights
              against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the
              law. This principle requires not only that individuals have
              enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals
              have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate
              and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
