            Cancellation: Attendee may cancel only by written notice to IFBC
            sent by certified mail or return receipt requested. Attendees shall
            remain obligated to pay the total fee unless written notice of
            cancellation is received and accepted by the IFBC on or before four
            (4) calendar months prior to the event start date, in which case
            attendee shall be liable for 50% of the total fee. The parties agree
            that the amount for which attendees shall be liable is considered to
            be liquidated and agreed-upon damages for the injuries the IFBC will
            suffer as a result of attendees’ cancellation. This provision for
            liquidated and agreed-upon damages is a bona fide provision and not

            reserved from availability at the time when other parties may have
            been interested in applying for it will cause the IFBC to sustain
            economic damages which will not be capable of determination with
            mathematical precision. Therefore, the provision for liquidated and
            agreed-upon damages has been incorporated into this agreement as a
            valid pre-estimate of these damages. The IFBC shall be entitled to
            close down an exhibit table or deny involvement in any event
            activity at any time for failure by any attendee to perform, meet or
            observe any terms or conditions set forth herein, and such attendee
            shall not be entitled to any refund or any part of any fees. In the
            event that the attendee or sponsor decides to cancel this agreement
            according to the terms and conditions contained herein, and should
            the cancellation be received by IFBC 30 days or less prior to the
            commitment of event set up, the attendee or sponsor agrees to pay
            the IFBC any additional expenses the IFBC may incur.
