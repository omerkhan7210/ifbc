            Cancellation: Attendee may cancel only by written notice to IFBC

            remain obligated to pay the total fee unless written notice of
            cancellation is received and accepted by the IFBC on or before four
            (4) calendar months prior to the event start date, in which case
            attendee shall be liable for 50% of the total fee. The parties agree
            that the amount for which attendees shall be liable is considered to
            be liquidated and agreed-upon damages for the injuries the IFBC will

            reserved from availability at the time when other parties may have

            economic damages which will not be capable of determination with

            close down an exhibit table or deny involvement in any event
            activity at any time for failure by any attendee to perform, meet or

            event that the attendee or sponsor decides to cancel this agreement
            according to the terms and conditions contained herein, and should
            the cancellation be received by IFBC 30 days or less prior to the
            commitment of event set up, the attendee or sponsor agrees to pay
            the IFBC any additional expenses the IFBC may incur.
