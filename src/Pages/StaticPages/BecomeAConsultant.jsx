          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 candidate-label">
            An IFBC Franchise Consultant's role is to conduct one-on-one
            consultations with clients interested in purchasing a franchise.
            IFBC's proprietary technology equips an IFBC franchise consultant
            with the tools to identify opportunities that align with a
            prospect's ideal business. The IFBC Franchise Consultant is not a
            salesperson but rather a matchmaker between the client and the right
            franchisor. Career counselors, outplacement consultants, attorneys,
            accountants, bankers, and other clients looking for quality
            franchises can expect IFBC Franchise Consultants to curate an
            ongoing referral network. They also assist clients in locating
            legal, accounting, and financial resources for specific franchises.
